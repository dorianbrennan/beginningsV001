<p>An old man is holding his wife’s hand. 
They are reminiscing about the lives they had. What they have done. Where they have travelled. The children they have raised. 
The wife brings up the painting that defined their youth. It always brings a smile to them both. 

Time passes and the old man decides to go on a trip. He travels by himself to the painting that’s still in the same gallery he and his wife had
viewed it many years ago. 

He takes a seat conveniently placed looking directly at it. People are walking around looking at all the artwork on the walls. Some glance at the old man and smile.  

He sits for hours. He is remembering the good times he had with his wife the life they had together and everything this painting meant to
them.

Suddenly the old man notices the space is empty. His wife walks in from the connecting gallery. A smile starts to appear on his face. 

He gets up, takes her hand. They walk over to the painting and take it in one last time. He squeezes her hand three times, like he always
has, and they both turn and walk out of the gallery. 

A child notices an old man sitting on a chair. He pulls on the arm of his dad and whispers ‘I think his asleep dad’.
The father walks over to the old man and taps him on the shoulder. 
The old mans eyes stay closed.</p>
