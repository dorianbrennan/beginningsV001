# about

### Welcome - April 2019
So this is my site, welcome. 
It might be a bit sparse at this point but I'm committed to updating it, changing the layout and just experimenting with what I think works and looks good. 

I've got no website or coding experience and I'm using this site to educate myself in both. For those that are interested I will be writing this in [markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) and hosting it on [github](https://github.com/dorianbrennan/beginnings "github"). 

So check back in from time to time to see what's new. 

Also you can get in contact with me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/dorian_brennan "twitter").
